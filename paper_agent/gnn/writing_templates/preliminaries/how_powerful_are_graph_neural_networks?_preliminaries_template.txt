\section{Preliminaries}

We begin by summarizing [insert common models/techniques] and introduce our notation. Let [insert notation for the main variables] denote a [describe the structure, e.g., graph, dataset]. There are two tasks of interest: (1) [Task 1 description], where [insert definition of task 1]; (2) [Task 2 description], where [insert definition of task 2].

\subsection{[Title of the Technical Section]}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.]

[Describe the detailed workflow of the module, including key concepts and methods.]

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:

\begin{equation}
[Insert mathematical formulation]
\end{equation}

where [insert explanation of each term in the equation].

[Another paragraph discussing different architectures, techniques, or methods relevant to [insert topic or focus]. For instance, various [insert related works] have been proposed. In particular, we look at [insert specific examples or discussions].]

For [task or application], [insert description of result or application]. [Further explain the implications or significance of the method.]

\subsection{[Title of Another Relevant Section]}

[Summarize the relevant theory or background necessary for understanding the context of the research.]

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.]

The [insert relevant concept or theory] is [insert definition or explanation]. This [insert description of how it relates to the main research question]. [Insert references to key works or theories that support your statements.]

Based on [insert relevant theory or work], [describe any new concepts, methods, or techniques introduced]. For example, [insert explanation of how the new concept builds on previous work, including any mathematical formulations if applicable]:

\begin{equation}
[Insert mathematical formulation relevant to the new concept]
\end{equation}

To conclude, [insert a summary of the key takeaways or implications of the discussed content and how it will lead to your contributions or experiments in the following sections].
