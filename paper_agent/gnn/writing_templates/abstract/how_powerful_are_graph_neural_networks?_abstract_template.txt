\section*{Abstract}

[First sentence summarizing the broader context and significance of the research domain. For example: "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a pivotal approach in [research area]."]

[Sentence describing the foundational approach and methodology. Example: "GNNs utilize [specific method] that allows for [key function or purpose]."]

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method. For instance: "Despite the advancements in [field], there remain [gap/issue]. This work addresses this challenge by [explanation of novelty]."]

[To tackle [specific challenge or problem], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].]

[Formally, we define [concept] as follows:] 

\begin{equation}
[Insert mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

[Detailed explanation of each term in the equations. For example: "In this equation, [term1] represents [description], while [term2] accounts for [description]."]

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches. Example: "While previous methods such as [method 1] and [method 2] have shown [specific outcomes], our approach distinguishes itself by [key differences]."]

[We then detail how the theoretical findings lead to the development of our proposed model. For instance: "We develop [module name], a [description of the architecture] that is [key property]."]

[Paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module. For instance: "The workflow consists of [step 1], followed by [step 2], ultimately leading to [step 3]."]

[We empirically validate our theoretical findings by [method of validation]. Our experiments show that [major result or conclusion].]

[Closing sentence highlighting the impact or significance of the findings. Example: "Therefore, our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on [benchmarks or tasks] but also enhances the understanding of [concept]."]
